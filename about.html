                    <h1><strong>About Us.</strong></h1>
                    <p>Troop-to-Task was created by Rob Miotla in 2024 following the creation of his military-centric software business, Fire and Move, LLC. Rob served 8 years in the United States Marine Corps as a Combat Engineer and as the Chief Instructor at The Basic School. Throughout his career, Rob found himself or others on all ends of ineffective communication which frequently hindered mission accomplishment. There have always been band-aid solutions to communication problems in the Marine Corps, such as changes in doctrine or standard operating procedures. These vary unit to unit, and they have never been a permanent fix.</p>
                    <p>Rob Miotla, as a trained problem-solver and passionate Marine, took it upon himself to address communicative friction service-wide. He wanted to do what nobody else has done before: create a platform designed to enhance lateral communication and planning, specifically tailored for the needs of the everyday Marine. Thus, the Troop-to-Task planning application was born.</p>
